     <P>The culture of Bangladesh is intertwined with the culture of the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent.<br>
         It has evolved over the centuries and encompasses the cultural diversity of several social groups of Bangladesh.<br>
          The Bengal Renaissance of the 18th early 19th centuries, noted Bengali writers, saints, authors, scientists,<br>
           researchers, thinkers, music composers, painters, film-makers have played a significant role in the development <br>
            of Bengali culture. The Bengal Renaissance contained the seeds of a nascent political Indian nationalism which was <br>
             the precursor in many ways to modern Indian artistic cultural expression</P>

    <p> Bangladesh, to the east of India on the Bay of Bengal, <br>
        is a South Asian country marked by lush greenery and <br>
        many waterways. Padma (Ganges), Meghna and Jamuna rivers <br>
        create fertile plains,and travel by boat is common. <br>
        On the southern coast, the Sundarbans,an enormous <br>
        mangrove forest shared with Eastern India,is home to <br>
        the royal Bengal tiger </p>
    <p> Bangladesh is bordered by the Indian states of West Bengal to the west and north,
        Assam to the north, Meghalaya to the north and northeast,
        and Tripura and Mizoram to the east. To the southeast, it shares a boundary with Myanmar (Burma).
        The southern part of Bangladesh opens into the Bay of Bengal.</p>

    <p> The Barind is a somewhat elevated triangular wedge of land that
            lies between the floodplains of the upper Padma and
            Jamuna rivers in northwestern Bangladesh.
            A depression called the Bhar Basin extends southeast
            from the Barind for about 100 miles (160 km) to the confluence of the Padma and Jamuna. </i> </p>
